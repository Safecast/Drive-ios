Safecast Drive iOS app
=======================

![Drivecast](Assets/drivecast.png)

Safecast Drive is an app that enables you to:

- Connect with your bGeigieNano (as long as you have the Bluetooth LE module installed) record data and upload them to the [Safecast API](https://api.safecast.org/) directly. No need to remove your MicroSD card anymore!
- Access previous logs and update their status.

# Supported devices

In the current version, Safecast Drive is only compatible with the [bGeigieNano geiger counter](http://blog.safecast.org/bgeigie-nano/) equipped with a [BLEBee module](https://github.com/michaelkroll/BLEbee).

# Learn more about us

Safecast is an international, volunteer-centered organization devoted to open citizen science for the environment. After the devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011, and the subsequent meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, accurate and trustworthy radiation information was publicly unavailable. Safecast was formed in response, and quickly began monitoring, collecting, and openly sharing information on environmental radiation and other pollutants, growing quickly in size, scope, and geographical reach. Our mission is to provide citizens worldwide with the tools they need to inform themselves by gathering and sharing accurate environmental data in an open and participatory fashion.
